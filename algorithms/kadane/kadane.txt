Maximum subarray problem

=> Given an array of number :
  Find the continuous subarray that has the largest sum when summing all his components
  Return the sum

Examples :

* [2, 1, 2, 0]
  => 5 (the subarray is always the array itself when all the numbers are positives)

* [1, -3, 2, 1, -1]
  => 3, the subarray [2, 1] is the one having the largest sum of components
